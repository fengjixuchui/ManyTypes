# ManyTypes

C/C++ type parsing library based on libclang.

This project was intended to parse windows headers and phnt.h in order to generate type data which is parsable by x64dbg.

**This only works with [x64dbg fork](https://github.com/notpidgey/x64dbg) for now** 

## x64dbg usage
When starting a x64dbg debug session with the plugin enabled, ManyTypes will create a folder in the root of x64dbg called `ManyTypes/[ImageName]`.
This folder will contain a `project.h` file. 

When the file is updated, ManyTypes will attempt to **only parse the header `project.h`**
Other headers in `ManyTypes/[ImageName]` will be ignored, but they may be included in `project.h`

TLDR:
1. Start debug session
2. Open `x64dbg/ManyTypes/[ImageName]`
3. Edit and save `project.h`
4. Use the newly created type in struct window.
5. Profit

Do not modify source.cpp, it is autogenerated and clang is ran on this source file.

## Library Usage
Todo

## Missing Features
- Template parsing
- Collapsing array type into single x64dbg field

## Building Notes
Build and copy the provided (or your own) libclang.dll into the build directory (I’ll automate this later). If you’re using your own version, make sure it matches by placing it in the extern/libclang.lib folder.
