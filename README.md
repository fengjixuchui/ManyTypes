# ManyTypes
**This only works with [x64dbg fork](https://github.com/notpidgey/x64dbg/tree/struct-view-update) for now**

## Using ManyTypes with x64dbg
### Basic Steps:
1. Start debug session
2. Open `x64dbg/ManyTypes/[ImageName]` or click `Plugins | manytypes-plugin | Open in Explorer`
3. Edit and save `project.h`
4. Use the newly created type in struct window.

### How can I always import Windows types?
Add `#include "windows.h"` to `global.h` such that when a `project.h` is generated for a new debug session, `global.h` will automatically be included and contain Windows types.

### Notes:
Do not modify source.cpp, it is autogenerated and clang is ran on this source file.

## Library Usage
Todo. See x64dbg or clang formatters for usage of the type database.

## Missing Features
- Template parsing
- Inheritance 
- Types with semantic parents

## Building Notes
Build and copy the provided (or your own) libclang.dll into the build directory (I’ll automate this later). If you’re using your own version, make sure it matches by placing it in the extern/libclang.lib folder.
